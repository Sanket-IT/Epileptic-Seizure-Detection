<h2>Abstract</h2>
Around 50 million individuals worldwide suffer
with epilepsy, a chronic, non-communicable brain disorder.
Several screening methods, including electroencephalography,
have been proposed to identify epileptic episodes. EEG data,
which are frequently utilized to enhance epilepsy analysis, offer
essential information on the electrical processes of the brain.
Prior to the emergence of DL, feature extraction was
accomplished by standard machine learning techniques. As a
result, they were only as good as the people who made the
features by hand. But with DL, both feature extraction and
classification are fully automated. These methods have
significantly advanced several fields of medicine, including the
diagnosis of epilepsy. In this study, the works focused on
automated epileptic seizure detection using ML and DL
techniques is presented as well as their comparative analysis is
done. UCI- Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset is used for
training and validation. Some of the conventional machine
learning algorithms and Deep Learning algorithm used with
model which uses LSTM to find best approach. Post
that comparative analysis is performed on these algorithms to
find the best approach for Epileptic Seizure Detection. As a
result, model LSTM gives validation accuracy of
97% gives most appropriate and precise result as compared to
other mentioned algorithms used in this study.
